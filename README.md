# Visitor Pattern Introduction #

Repository created for internal workshop that I held in Netgen.

First of many, hope so. :)

If you want to execute code, just run tests:

`php ./vendor/bin/phpunit`

or each test by itself:

`php ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Visitor/PageCountVisitorTest.php`

`php ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Visitor/AuthorFinderVisitorTest.php`
